        <p>
            The Sauna as known in the western world today originates from Finland. There are built-in saunas in almost every house in Finland. The oldest known saunas in Finland were made from pits dug in a slope in the ground and primarily used as dwellings in winter. The sauna featured a fireplace where stones were heated to a high temperature. Water was thrown on the hot stones to produce steam and to give a sensation of increased heat. This would raise the apparent temperature so high that people could take off their clothes. The first Finnish saunas are what nowadays are called savusaunas, or smoke saunas. These differed from present-day saunas in that they were heated by heating a pile of rocks called kiuas by burning large amounts of wood about 6 to 8 hours, and then letting the smoke out before enjoying the löyly, or sauna heat. A properly heated "savusauna" gives heat up to 12 hours.

			Under many circumstances, temperatures approaching and exceeding 100 °C (212 °F) would be completely intolerable and possibly fatal if exposed to long periods of time. Saunas overcome this problem by controlling the humidity. The hottest Finnish saunas have relatively low humidity levels in which steam is generated by pouring water on the hot stones. This allows air temperatures that could boil water to be tolerated and even enjoyed for longer periods of time. Steam baths, such as the Turkish bath, where the humidity approaches 100%, will be set to a much lower temperature of around 40 °C (104 °F) to compensate. The "wet heat" would cause scalding if the temperature were set much higher.

			As an additional facility, a sauna may have one or more jacuzzis. In some spa centers, there are the so-called special "snow rooms". Also known as a cold sauna or cryotherapy, it works as a way to draw blood flow into the body core and stimulate the body's white blood cells to help fight disease much the same way a hot sauna does. Operating at a temperature of −110 °C (−166 °F), the user is in the sauna for a period of only about 3 minutes.

			Sauna use may temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold. It increases the heat tolerance threshold and may improve performance in endurance sport. Sauna may help rheumatic pain (with cold shower) but not neuropathic pain, and has also shown usefulness for appetite loss and mild depression. It has also been recommended for reducing symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis, and for anorexia nervosa, and been proposed for treatment of other conditions including glaucoma, Sjogren syndrome, and obstructive lung disease, and for recuperation after childbirth.
